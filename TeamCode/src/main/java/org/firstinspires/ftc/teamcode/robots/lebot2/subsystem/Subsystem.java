/**
 * Base interface for all robot subsystems.
 *
 * A subsystem is an independent unit that manages a specific part of the robot.
 * Each subsystem:
 * - Owns specific hardware (motors, servos, sensors)
 * - Has its own state machine (if needed)
 * - Provides telemetry for debugging
 * - Updates via the three-phase cycle
 *
 * The Robot class coordinates subsystems and handles cross-subsystem behaviors.
 *
 * THREE-PHASE UPDATE CYCLE:
 * Every loop, Robot calls these methods in order for ALL subsystems:
 *
 *   Phase 1: readSensors() - Read I2C sensors, cache values
 *   Phase 2: calc()        - State machines, PID, logic (use cached values)
 *   Phase 3: act()         - Flush lazy motor/servo commands to hardware
 *
 * This pattern ensures:
 * - All sensor reads happen before any calculations (no stale data)
 * - All calculations complete before any hardware writes
 * - I2C reads are consolidated for efficiency
 *
 * JUNIOR CODER RULES:
 * - Put all your code in calc()
 * - Use cachedSensor.getValue() not sensor.getValue()
 * - Use lazyMotor.setPower() not motor.setPower()
 * - Never call refresh() or flush() directly
